# Welcome!

Welcome to this plugin! This is the plugin that manages the portfolio behavior on the front page of my website. I know there are plugins that manage this very behavior, but what the hell, this is my portfolio site, right?

## Info

This plugin is super lightweight. It has one PHP file which defines the post type (portfolio_item), and then defines the shortcode to display a list of portfolio items (portfolio_items). It controls the CSS circle behavior that's shown on the page as well (the circle trick uses a little bit of CSS hackery).

## Versioning

This plugin is currently in __Version 0.2__. It's got post types, it's got regex, it's got shortcodes. That's about it, though...
