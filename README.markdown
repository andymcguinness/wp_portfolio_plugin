# Welcome!

Welcome to this plugin! This is the plugin that manages the portfolio behavior on the front page of my website. I know there are plugins that manage this very behavior, but what the hell, this is my portfolio site, right?

## Info

This plugin is super lightweight. It has one PHP file which defines the post type (portfolio_item), and then defines the shortcode to display a list of portfolio items (portfolio_items). It controls the CSS circle behavior that's shown on the page as well (the circle trick uses a little bit of CSS hackery). It has to use an XML parser at one point to get the source out of an image tag, but I had no choice--either way, I learned something new building this plugin!

## Versioning

This plugin is still in __Version 0.1__. While it's live, it's still very... interesting. There's also some more features I'd like to add to make it more robust before I push it to 1.0.
